# HIML

Hypo AI Markup Language, Make AI as easy as HTML!

AI technology has a high threshold for use, but we believe that in the future, AI technology will produce the same technology as HTML replacing GDI +. We started to develop a markup language in the field of AI, so as to reduce the threshold of AI to the same level as HTML, and make AI simple, which is the mission of HIML.

## About the Name

Why isn't HIML called HAIML or HAML? The first reason is that HAIML is a little long and hard to read. The second reason is that HI has a good meaning, which looks more like human beings and conforms to the positioning of AI.
